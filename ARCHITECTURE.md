# Software Architecture Improvement Plan

This document outlines the plan to refactor the project's architecture from a single-file structure to a more modular and scalable design.

### 1. Separate Concerns

The application will be broken down into distinct modules for the server, tools, and services. This will improve code organization and make it easier to add new features in the future.

### 2. Introduce a Service Layer

A dedicated service layer will encapsulate all interactions with the Chatvolt API. This will centralize API logic, making it reusable and easier to maintain.

### 3. Implement a Tools Directory

Each tool will have its own file within a `src/tools` directory. An `index.ts` file in this directory will be responsible for registering all available tools. This promotes a clean and scalable structure for adding new tools.

### 4. Add Unit Testing

A testing framework will be set up to ensure the reliability and correctness of the tools and services. This will involve creating test files for each tool and service.

### 5. Centralized Configuration

Environment variables and other configurations will be managed in a more structured way to improve security and maintainability.
